- edgectl bootstrap must be idempotent: |
    If `edgectl-e2e run <test-id>` passes once, it should pass twice (and more)
- spec: |
    fix the discrepancies in this repo regarding the spec file data structure.
    The authoritative source is information from @cmd/edge-cd/.
    The goal is:
    - To create a spec pkg under ./pkg/spec that reflect the data structure described in @cmd/edge-cd/.
      All tools such as edgectl or edgectl-e2e must use the spec struct defined in ./pkg/spec/spec.go (which data structures comes from @cmd/edge-cd/ as an authoritative source).
    - Fix all documentation, spec.yaml/config.yaml so they comply to the authoritative source
